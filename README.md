# React Node Mongo Starter

## Introduction

> As I have some time between 2 projects I thought that it might be a good idea to create such a starter. Why? From time to time I have some personal projects that needs authorization, and everytime I start , I do it from scratch. Such a time wasting... Still it's not perfect, but from time to time we will push some updates.
